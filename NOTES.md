# Notes

The exercise involves developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game strictly adhering to the TDD rules.
The system should run in BOT mode (random BOT moves for player X & O) to print on the screen all the player's moves (with a 2 seconds timeout between each round) until someone won or the game ends with a draw.
